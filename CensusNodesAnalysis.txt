1. Are the node addresses different or the same?
The two node addresses are the same.
2. If so, how do you explain why they are the same or different? 
Because a pointer to object is not destroyed, value or memory block pointed by pointer is destroyed, and the delete operator has void return type does not return a value.
3. Are the node addresses adjacent to each other in memory in each of the files or not?
No, they are not.
4. Why would the addresses be adjacent if they are, or why would they not be adjacent if they are not?
Because a linked list consists of items called “Nodes” which contain two parts. The first part stores the actual data and the second part has a pointer that points to the next node. This structure is usually called “Singly linked list”.
